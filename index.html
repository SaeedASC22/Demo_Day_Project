            Welcome
        </h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to All Star Life. Hello teenagers 
            and new adults. 
            As you venture into college or whatever 
            endeavours you which to pursue in your 
            adult life. There are some important 
            skills you must learn so as to ensure the 
            difficulties you face will prove to be 
            much less of a hinderance for you. 
            Unfortunatetly for many, schools lack the 
            staff budget and insight to teach these to 
            students often leading to students
            struggling  more than is necessary. Here 
            you can learn all these skills and will be 
            able to apply them and help other people 
            learn more of these skills. We hope you 
            enjoy yourself here and are able to learn 
            and teach more life skills.
        </p>
