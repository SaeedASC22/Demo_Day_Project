            <h2>  Doing your Taxes</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the year the government takes taxes from your income so as to fund various government programs. Due to this as you receive your paycheck your employer takes away some of your income as tax. 
                So whenever you file your tax returns you give the government information to determine how much money you made, how much money you should have sent in and how much you actually sent. If you sent in too much money you get a refund and if you didn't send enough you have to pay it back. 
                To begin you need a tax form which you get after December. Employers will give you a W2 tax form in January. If you have earned over 10 dollars in interest income from a bank you will recieve a 1099 INT from a bank. If you were involved in the stock market you will recieve a 1099 B tax from from late january to february from you stock broker. If you have student loans you will receive a 1098 E which shows how much you paid in interest from student loans lowering your taxes . If you pay tuition at a school you will receive a 1098 T which will also help lower your taxes.
                After you get all your tax forms you can do it yourself or use a tax accountant. If you arw filing it alone a software program would be reccomended and often tax offer companies often have a basic version to make thing simpler. There are many you can use such as <a href = https://turbotax.intuit.com>Turbo Tax </a>, <a href = https://www.taxact.com>Tax Act </a> and <a href = https://www.hrblock.com> H&R Block</a>.
